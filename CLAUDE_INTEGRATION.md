# Claude AI Integration

This document outlines the changes made to integrate Claude AI (Anthropic) into the application
## Updates Made

1. **AI Service**
   - Updated API calls to use the Claude-3-Haiku model (latest cheaper model)
   - Maintained the same prompt structure and function extraction capabilities

2. **Backend Dependencies**
   - Added Anthropic Python SDK to requirements.txt
   - Provided .env.example with ANTHROPIC_API_KEY template

3. **Removed Automations Feature**
   - Removed automations_bp registration from server.py
   - Removed Automations link from SideBar component
   - Removed BlocksPage route from App.js

## Configuration Required

To use the Claude integration, you need to:

1. Copy .env.example to .env in the backend directory
2. Obtain an API key from Anthropic (https://console.anthropic.com/)
3. Add your Anthropic API key to the .env file as ANTHROPIC_API_KEY

## User Experience

The user experience remains the same with these improvements:

- AI chat interface works as before, but now using Claude AI
- Email and calendar functionality remain unchanged
- The ChatSidebar component continues to work as expected
- Automations feature is now removed for simplicity

## Claude Model Details

We're using the Claude-3-Haiku model, which offers:
- Good performance at a lower cost
- Fast response times
- Excellent instruction-following capabilities
- Ability to generate structured outputs (JSON)

## Testing

After implementing these changes, test the application by:
1. Starting the backend server
2. Testing the chat functionality
3. Verifying email and calendar integration still works
4. Checking that all navigation links work correctly

The application should perform as before but using Claude AI
